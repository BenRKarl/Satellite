Sites to consider in terms of design:

    - https://www.mapbox.com/
    - http://www.skyboximaging.com/

List of needs:

- fast loading
- fully responsive
- cms for managing all content
- scrolling homepage with explanation of the project
- blog
- team page
- contact page - with contact form
- gallery page (with images + video)
- follow/like/pin buttons
- Use the google font Open Sans for now for all copy
- I will work on the logo png, you can use a placeholder for now
- responsive should be 3x300px columns for desktop, 2 for tablet, and 1 for mobile
- all text and images should be editable in admin
- for the page content, each component should be editable like a blog post in cms.  we dont need rich text editing tools, can just be html as we know how to edit it.
